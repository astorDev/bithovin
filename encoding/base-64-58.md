# Structure

- [ ] Intro
    - [ ] Reference hex article.
    - [ ] 
    - [ ] 
    - [ ] Convert hex to binary ("Told you it's 0s and 1s after all").
    - [ ] Convert binary to hex - Note that hex and binary are essentially different representations of the same thing
- [ ] Base64
    - [ ] Propose the question if the hex is not that different from the binary can we get hex from a file
    - [ ] Answer that we can and convert `small-ferret.jpeg` into hex, using https://emn178.github.io/online-tools/hex_encode_file.html. 
    - [ ] Count chars: 26588 and note that it's a very long string. Propose a question of whether can we use more symbols and move from 16-radix to more
    - [ ] Answer that we can and introduce Base64 (with it's character set)
    - [ ] Convert small ferret into base64 using https://emn178.github.io/online-tools/base64_encode_file.html. Count characters: 17728
    - [ ] Challenge moving back from base64 to image. Prove it using https://diewland.github.io/base64toImage/
- [ ] Base58
    - [ ] Reference Bitcoin article, highlighting a private key is a big number
    - [ ] Propose using a smaller number, e.g. 3885384 (that number is specially used since it uses base58 removed symbols)
    - [ ] Convert it to binary https://math.tools/calculator/base/10-2, then to base64 https://math.tools/calculator/base/2-64
        - Note that it can also be done faster via https://math.tools/calculator/base/10-64
    - [ ] Highlight the problem with similarly looking chars in the base64 (O0lI)
    - [ ] Highlight that this is the problem that Base58 solves + mention there's also Version Byte and Checksum, but they are out of the scope of the article.
    - [ ] Convert the same number to base58 (get not conflicting LuzP)
- [ ] Final
    - [ ] Recap with the list of encodings accompanied by a short description and use cases.
