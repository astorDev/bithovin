# How to talk in 1s and 0s?

## Creating an encoding

`Initial Encoding table`: 

| Char | Code In Decimal | Code in binary |
|------|-----------------|----------------|
| A    | 0               | 0              |   
| B    | 1               | 1              |
| C    | 2               | 10             |
| D    | 3               | 11             |
| E    | 4               | 100            |
| F    | 5               | 101            |
| G    | 6               | 110            |
| H    | 7               | 111            |

`H A C -> 111 0 10`

`111010`

`11 10 1 0 -> D C B A`

`Redefined Encoding Table`

| Char | Code In Decimal | Code in binary |
|------|-----------------|----------------|
| A    | 0               | 000            |   
| B    | 1               | 001            |
| C    | 2               | 010            |
| D    | 3               | 011            |
| E    | 4               | 100            |
| F    | 5               | 101            |
| G    | 6               | 110            |
| H    | 7               | 111            |

`H A C -> 111 000 010`

`111000010`

`111 000 010 -> HAC`

This encoding logic is the exactly the logic used in the encoding dominant from the mid-1960s to the early 1990s, called ASCII. Of course, the ASCII table consisted of more then just 8 symbols. And 33

## Introducing clever rules. UTF-8

## TLDR

# Proposed Structure

- [ ] Introduction
    - [ ] Mention the thesis of computer talking in 1s and 0s
    - [ ] Propose asking how would we pass a message like "Hello" (pick something illustrative for padding problem). 
- [ ] Naive Encoding and ASCII
    - [ ] Assign codes to few letters: create 3-bit encoding
    - [ ] Encode the message (naive way).
    - [ ] Decode the message incorrectly (highlighting the problem).
    - [ ] Propose padding.
    - [ ] Encode and decode correctly
    - [ ] Note that we just created/reproduced ASCII, with notice that it consisted of more characters.
    - [ ] Decode "Hi" using the real ASCII encodings.
- [ ] UTF-8
    - [ ] Highlight that ASCII only included English letters and that this was not enough
    - [ ] Highlight that if we use fixed size encoding it will probably be too redundant
    - [ ] Explain what UTF did instead
    - [ ] Decode a message from two non-ASCII characters.
    - [ ] Decode an actual message.
- [ ] Recap
    - [ ] Here's how you talk in bytes: You map 7 0s and 1s to our "real" symbols and send chuncks of 7 bits instead of the actual symbols
    - [ ] If you want to get fancy before sending the actual "code" send information about how long the code will be. That What UTF-8 did.
    - [ ] TLDR hex. And tell that explaining "What the hex? (the pun intended)" is out of the scope of this article.
    - [ ] Say that for now you just cover basics "So for the AI takeover you know the basics of computers "language" ðŸ˜„."
